Co-Facilitator,yes
Co-Facilitator,we were on 4 right
Co-Facilitator,okay can someone tell me what we learned last session
Co-Facilitator,can someone explain to suzette what happened
Co-Facilitator,okay so last lesson we learned how to do binary numbers okay as in zero and one okay the we also learned how to convert binary into hexadecimal hexadecimal is how you get the color of a thing right any of them black brown white green red like that those colors okay so on this table we actually learned how to convert them im gonna yeah im gonna show you a few examples okay okay then after that we did  okay then after that um then here its showing how the hexadecimal table works okay it starts from zero so the hexadecimal is from zero to nine and it starts going a b c d e f it only goes up to f then it stops okay so zero to f then in decimal numbers its zero to fifteen right
Co-Facilitator,okay  come sit over here so i can show you a few examples
Co-Facilitator,its against the law to kill your students
Co-Facilitator,im gonna since suzette wasnt here the last session im gonna go through a few examples with her
Co-Facilitator,we already did it
Co-Facilitator,yeah were just on the final one im just catching suzette up
Co-Facilitator,were gonna do  okay so so pick any number pick any number from 1 to 50
Co-Facilitator,10 okay so 10 right so you how do you represent it in the decimal number as in with the little blocks
Co-Facilitator,just one block of ten right  so right here you know how it goes two to the power of zero is one right two to the power of one is two two power two is four 2 to the power of 3 is 8 2 to the power of 4 is 16 and 2 to the power of 5 is 32 right its basically saying like since this is 2 times 1 you only put 2 ones then one so its two times one then here its two to the power of two right so its two times two the two to the power of three is two times two times two them two to the power of four is two times two times two times two them two to the power of five is two times two times two times two times two then it goes on and on and on right so right now i feel like sneezing okay so right now im gonna show you how to convert 10 into binary right
Co-Facilitator,okay so right now is 32 less or greater than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off since youll go over  is 16 greater or less than 10
Co-Facilitator,right so you also turn it off is 8 greater or lower than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on okay then 8 plus 4
Co-Facilitator,is it greater or less than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off and then 8 plus 2
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on right 10 plus 1
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on or off
Co-Facilitator,yeah that way is how you represent 10 in binary
Co-Facilitator,do you want to try another one okay what number do you want
Co-Facilitator,5 so five its just like 1 2 3 4 5 okay so now is 32 greater or less than 5
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off right do you turn 16 on or off
Co-Facilitator,how about 8
Co-Facilitator,how about 4
Co-Facilitator,how about 2
Co-Facilitator,on okay so the number is 5 right
