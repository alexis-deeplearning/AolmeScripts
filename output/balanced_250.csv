Co-Facilitator,but i want it im going to see if i can get a black folder and then paint like a skull
Co-Facilitator,i like it like that
Co-Facilitator,what are you doing
Co-Facilitator,this is the program that we did last time
Co-Facilitator, you want to switch here you go benny
Co-Facilitator,yes its final i have made my final decision
Co-Facilitator,do it
Co-Facilitator,no its a z instead of an s look s u z is it  wait let me see
Co-Facilitator,i knew there was a double letter there it is so okay
Co-Facilitator,hello hello 
Co-Facilitator,you wrote it wrong
Co-Facilitator,okay hit the power button suzette under it the first button
Co-Facilitator,what
Co-Facilitator,judith
Co-Facilitator,judith j u d
Co-Facilitator,yes judith
Co-Facilitator,okay i want to go over what we learned last session so we can do the last one who wasnt here last session
Co-Facilitator,you okay
Co-Facilitator,hello
Co-Facilitator,yes
Co-Facilitator,yes im just getting 
Co-Facilitator,yes
Co-Facilitator,we were on 4 right
Co-Facilitator,okay can someone tell me what we learned last session
Co-Facilitator,can someone explain to suzette what happened
Co-Facilitator,okay so last lesson we learned how to do binary numbers okay as in zero and one okay the we also learned how to convert binary into hexadecimal hexadecimal is how you get the color of a thing right any of them black brown white green red like that those colors okay so on this table we actually learned how to convert them im gonna yeah im gonna show you a few examples okay okay then after that we did  okay then after that um then here its showing how the hexadecimal table works okay it starts from zero so the hexadecimal is from zero to nine and it starts going a b c d e f it only goes up to f then it stops okay so zero to f then in decimal numbers its zero to fifteen right
Co-Facilitator,okay  come sit over here so i can show you a few examples
Co-Facilitator,its against the law to kill your students
Co-Facilitator,im gonna since suzette wasnt here the last session im gonna go through a few examples with her
Co-Facilitator,we already did it
Co-Facilitator,yeah were just on the final one im just catching suzette up
Co-Facilitator,were gonna do  okay so so pick any number pick any number from 1 to 50
Co-Facilitator,10 okay so 10 right so you how do you represent it in the decimal number as in with the little blocks
Co-Facilitator,just one block of ten right  so right here you know how it goes two to the power of zero is one right two to the power of one is two two power two is four 2 to the power of 3 is 8 2 to the power of 4 is 16 and 2 to the power of 5 is 32 right its basically saying like since this is 2 times 1 you only put 2 ones then one so its two times one then here its two to the power of two right so its two times two the two to the power of three is two times two times two them two to the power of four is two times two times two times two them two to the power of five is two times two times two times two times two then it goes on and on and on right so right now i feel like sneezing okay so right now im gonna show you how to convert 10 into binary right
Co-Facilitator,okay so right now is 32 less or greater than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off since youll go over  is 16 greater or less than 10
Co-Facilitator,right so you also turn it off is 8 greater or lower than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on okay then 8 plus 4
Co-Facilitator,is it greater or less than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off and then 8 plus 2
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on right 10 plus 1
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on or off
Co-Facilitator,yeah that way is how you represent 10 in binary
Co-Facilitator,do you want to try another one okay what number do you want
Co-Facilitator,5 so five its just like 1 2 3 4 5 okay so now is 32 greater or less than 5
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off right do you turn 16 on or off
Co-Facilitator,how about 8
Co-Facilitator,how about 4
Co-Facilitator,how about 2
Co-Facilitator,on okay so the number is 5 right
Co-Facilitator,off right and one
Co-Facilitator,right so the binary is 0b101 but in binary you can just take off the  zeros and  try one on your own what number do you want
Co-Facilitator,11 okay remember if its greater turn it off it its lower turn it on the add them up to see if you go over or if you need a bit more okay
Co-Facilitator, so thats how you spell 11 in binary want to try another one or do you think you got it
Co-Facilitator,okay
Co-Facilitator,miss can you turn the computer on
Co-Facilitator,the computer
Co-Facilitator,turn it on the button on the bottom
Co-Facilitator,it turned off
Co-Facilitator,oh there it says there isnt a signal
Co-Facilitator, the computer wont turn on
Co-Facilitator,we just need one more exercise to finish 4
Co-Facilitator, i caught suzette up on
Co-Facilitator,mhmm
Co-Facilitator,shes a fast learner
Co-Facilitator,okay now what were going to do is complete this table these numbers here you have to convert to binary numbers and then to hexadecimal numbers do you remember what that is right
Co-Facilitator,no yes then explain what it is
Co-Facilitator,no you
Co-Facilitator,what are hexadecimal numbers
Co-Facilitator,okay a hexadecimal number is a number that does from 0 to f
Co-Facilitator,it only goes up to 9 and then it goes to a b c d e f then it stops there and then goes back to 0
Co-Facilitator,yes then convert binary numbers to hexadecimal is by putting the binary numbers into groups of four if there are just one or two numbers in a group we add 0 to the left of them to have 4 and then you look at the number it represents and then you put the number on it the number it represents you put it there then here you convert it as the table says  do you understand
Co-Facilitator,i was all night playing fortnite
Co-Facilitator,ps4
Co-Facilitator,yeah wait you have a pc
Co-Facilitator,well its free
Co-Facilitator,yeah yes
Co-Facilitator,no its free the only thing that you actually have to pay is for a skin
Co-Facilitator,its really cheap
Co-Facilitator,he does
Co-Facilitator,i barely even win
Co-Facilitator,i barely even win because i get killed from behind
Co-Facilitator,you do you have both
Facilitator,hello
Facilitator,doing okay
Facilitator,got everything you need
Facilitator,you have a little marker here you know that
Facilitator,okay
Facilitator,you guys have the numbers from zero to fifteen right
Facilitator,do you have the manipulatives
Facilitator,do you need the  or you already did it
Facilitator,you already did it everybody understands
Facilitator,okay
Facilitator,hello suzette what are they putting you to do today benny also congratulations what were you yesterday goalkeeper
