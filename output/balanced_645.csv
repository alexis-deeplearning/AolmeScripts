Student,mhmm
Student,okay so
Student,yes
Student,okay so you have
Student,name
Student,unintelligible
Student,zero
Student,a three
Student,one three
Student,one ten thousand ten thousand ten hundred times plus
Student,the point
Student,okay yeah i can survive so hit enter and put the command green and now the parentisis so what would we like to print so the answer right what is the answer there
Student,to give the answer
Student,what are we gonna do now
Student,multiplying
Student,okay so x means 6 so we have to multiply x by 2 which gives you 12 and then we have to add 3 and that gives you 15
Student,yeah
Student,it gives us a higher number
Student,this would be nine
Student,right
Student,nine
Student,this right
Student,was it
Student,and also these ones right
Student,subtract
Student,divide by what was it five
Student,ten
Student,okay think of a number 
Student,what is your answer
Student,okay divide by 2 was it suppose to say
Student,unintelligible phrase
Student,six
Student,first
Student,divide it by 2 cause 3 times 2
Student,six
Student,subtraction
Student,what
Student,should we do it
Student,ten
Student,wait
Student,no 2
Student,and then 3
Student,part 4
Student,that is her

Student,yes
Student,where
Student,i have to put the two lines at the time
Student,like this
Student,and that one
Student,this one
Student,with name
Student,you have a number right
Student,no
Student,give me a number and then multiply by 2
Student,okay
Student,enter
Student,so i type the number
Student,no enter and then type the number
Student,up 
Student,i did not see
Student,its printing it again
Student,its printing it again
Student,so 1
Student,and then is doing it again and is 11
Student,maybe because there is three prints
Student,one number one run the code below and see what happens two compare results here with the previous cell three which variables do you see in the loop four how do the variables change loop
Student,unintelligible
Student,cause its three
Student,nine
Student,mm 10
Student,unintelligible
Student,it doesnt appear
Student,b
Student,run the code below and see what happens compare the result with the previous statement which variables control the loop
Student,two
Student,i just did it
Student,okay
Student,yeah put that one
Student,me
Student,im suppose to think about it right
Student,what time does the bus from today comes
Student,okay what do we have to write

Student,ehm 
Student,because it makes the eighty
Student,take this one out
Student,and one of these put them here
Student,from these
Student,we just have a few left
Student,so here it is put the number that is here
Student,hey and what are these for
Student,what thing
Co-Facilitator,but i want it im going to see if i can get a black folder and then paint like a skull
Co-Facilitator,i like it like that
Co-Facilitator,what are you doing
Co-Facilitator,this is the program that we did last time
Co-Facilitator, you want to switch here you go benny
Co-Facilitator,yes its final i have made my final decision
Co-Facilitator,do it
Co-Facilitator,the power of terror ahorita viene el maestro porque tiene clases
Co-Facilitator,no its a z instead of an s look s u z is it  wait let me see
Co-Facilitator,i knew there was a double letter there it is so okay
Co-Facilitator,hello hello 
Co-Facilitator,you wrote it wrong
Co-Facilitator,okay hit the power button suzette under it the first button
Co-Facilitator,what
Co-Facilitator,judith
Co-Facilitator,judith j u d
Co-Facilitator,yes judith
Co-Facilitator,okay i want to go over what we learned last session so we can do the last one who wasnt here last session
Co-Facilitator,you okay
Co-Facilitator,hello
Co-Facilitator,yes
Co-Facilitator,yes im just getting 
Co-Facilitator,yes
Co-Facilitator,we were on 4 right
Co-Facilitator,okay can someone tell me what we learned last session
Co-Facilitator,can someone explain to suzette what happened
Co-Facilitator,okay so last lesson we learned how to do binary numbers okay as in zero and one okay the we also learned how to convert binary into hexadecimal hexadecimal is how you get the color of a thing right any of them black brown white green red like that those colors okay so on this table we actually learned how to convert them im gonna yeah im gonna show you a few examples okay okay then after that we did  okay then after that um then here its showing how the hexadecimal table works okay it starts from zero so the hexadecimal is from zero to nine and it starts going a b c d e f it only goes up to f then it stops okay so zero to f then in decimal numbers its zero to fifteen right
Co-Facilitator,okay  come sit over here so i can show you a few examples
Co-Facilitator,its against the law to kill your students
Co-Facilitator,im gonna since suzette wasnt here the last session im gonna go through a few examples with her
Co-Facilitator,we already did it
Co-Facilitator,yeah were just on the final one im just catching suzette up
Co-Facilitator,were gonna do  okay so so pick any number pick any number from 1 to 50
Co-Facilitator,10 okay so 10 right so you how do you represent it in the decimal number as in with the little blocks
Co-Facilitator,just one block of ten right  so right here you know how it goes two to the power of zero is one right two to the power of one is two two power two is four 2 to the power of 3 is 8 2 to the power of 4 is 16 and 2 to the power of 5 is 32 right its basically saying like since this is 2 times 1 you only put 2 ones then one so its two times one then here its two to the power of two right so its two times two the two to the power of three is two times two times two them two to the power of four is two times two times two times two them two to the power of five is two times two times two times two times two then it goes on and on and on right so right now i feel like sneezing okay so right now im gonna show you how to convert 10 into binary right
Co-Facilitator,okay so right now is 32 less or greater than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off since youll go over  is 16 greater or less than 10
Co-Facilitator,right so you also turn it off is 8 greater or lower than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on okay then 8 plus 4
Co-Facilitator,is it greater or less than 10
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off and then 8 plus 2
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on right 10 plus 1
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it on or off
Co-Facilitator,yeah that way is how you represent 10 in binary
Co-Facilitator,do you want to try another one okay what number do you want
Co-Facilitator,5 so five its just like 1 2 3 4 5 okay so now is 32 greater or less than 5
Co-Facilitator,so you turn it off right do you turn 16 on or off
Co-Facilitator,how about 8
Co-Facilitator,how about 4
Co-Facilitator,how about 2
Co-Facilitator,on okay so the number is 5 right
Co-Facilitator,off right and one
Co-Facilitator,right so the binary is 0b101 but in binary you can just take off the  zeros and  try one on your own what number do you want
Co-Facilitator,11 okay remember if its greater turn it off it its lower turn it on the add them up to see if you go over or if you need a bit more okay
Co-Facilitator, so thats how you spell 11 in binary want to try another one or do you think you got it
Co-Facilitator,okay
Co-Facilitator,miss can you turn the computer on
Co-Facilitator,the computer
Co-Facilitator,turn it on the button on the bottom
Co-Facilitator,it turned off
Co-Facilitator,oh there it says there isnt a signal
Co-Facilitator, the computer wont turn on
Co-Facilitator,we just need one more exercise to finish 4
Co-Facilitator, i caught suzette up on
Co-Facilitator,mhmm
Co-Facilitator,shes a fast learner
Co-Facilitator,okay now what were going to do is complete this table these numbers here you have to convert to binary numbers and then to hexadecimal numbers do you remember what that is right
Co-Facilitator,no yes then explain what it is
Co-Facilitator,no you
Co-Facilitator,what are hexadecimal numbers
Co-Facilitator,okay a hexadecimal number is a number that does from 0 to f
Co-Facilitator,it only goes up to 9 and then it goes to a b c d e f then it stops there and then goes back to 0
Co-Facilitator,yes then convert binary numbers to hexadecimal is by putting the binary numbers into groups of four if there are just one or two numbers in a group we add 0 to the left of them to have 4 and then you look at the number it represents and then you put the number on it the number it represents you put it there then here you convert it as the table says  do you understand
Co-Facilitator,so like the times too
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,or x
Co-Facilitator,x two
Co-Facilitator,dont be shy its okay
Co-Facilitator,yeah
Co-Facilitator,to me is like a command that you need is like a command that for example you dont put print on there but its obviously not gonna come out because you are telling it right that right and its gonna give you the answer
Co-Facilitator,these ones
Co-Facilitator,oh these ones
Co-Facilitator,its like the steps
Co-Facilitator,mm yes
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,yes lets move to the second
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,is there another card on this
Co-Facilitator,cause this is one is in this is it the same as this one
Co-Facilitator,okay
Co-Facilitator,once i read it do we just go to the next one
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible phrase
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible phrase
Co-Facilitator,yeah so like run it like two more times
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,no x equals a number so x in this thing would be six so its pretty much saying multiply 6 by 2 and that gives us 12 and then adding 3 and that gives us 15 so this is just the steps to it do we go to the next one
Co-Facilitator,yes do you guys understand like can you guys repeat what i said
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,so its this one
Co-Facilitator,2b
Co-Facilitator,okay 
Co-Facilitator,yeah okay so it shows us xy and c so what do you guys think a variable is
Co-Facilitator,so you are gonna change the numbers
Co-Facilitator,so with this one you change that one to
Co-Facilitator,no that it is in cell 2b cause its to change in operations
Co-Facilitator,difficult
Co-Facilitator,yeah so for 2 it will be 4 no or yes right is it right or is it nine
Co-Facilitator,and this one
Co-Facilitator,so run it
Co-Facilitator,so what changed
Co-Facilitator,so this is what she did is just change the number so its just changing the operation the number and yeah and the variables so its to do the same thing that you told said the x is the same thing the y is the same thing and then c is just changing the number and then giving you a different operation
Co-Facilitator,this one
Co-Facilitator,numbers
Co-Facilitator,nine
Co-Facilitator,and then this one
Co-Facilitator,are you doing right or left
Co-Facilitator,and then run it so keep the number
Co-Facilitator,its frozen
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible phrase
Co-Facilitator,where were we
Co-Facilitator,i think that you pass it
Co-Facilitator,yeah
Co-Facilitator,like these ones
Co-Facilitator,is that all for now
Co-Facilitator,no is that all for now
Co-Facilitator,no im saying is it all we have to type in
Co-Facilitator,okay
Co-Facilitator,so esta aca  yeah okay so what makes this game right okay the number guessing game to make this game work we need to think about inverse operations why do we need inverse operations for the number guessing game to work so why do you guys think that
Co-Facilitator,yeah
Co-Facilitator,maya
Co-Facilitator,you go
Co-Facilitator,what is it call
Co-Facilitator,yeah inverse operation
Co-Facilitator,so inverse just means opposite
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,no wait wait i said something wrong
Co-Facilitator,so then what do we put
Co-Facilitator,how do you say it
Co-Facilitator,so like we can skip this so like what did you say
Co-Facilitator,but the first thing you tell her
Co-Facilitator,so like the time you said multiplication and then addition and then its going to be division and subtraction its like getting rid of going to the number
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,its pretty straight forward okay what will this game do if any number add three and subtract it
Co-Facilitator,okay so maya give a number
Co-Facilitator,oh i told you wrong
Co-Facilitator,and then add three
Co-Facilitator,subtract three what is the answer
Co-Facilitator,how is that possible
Co-Facilitator,me too 
Co-Facilitator,add three
Co-Facilitator,and then subtract three
Co-Facilitator,i dont get that so
Co-Facilitator,oh okay oh okay so it just switches them okay i get it
Co-Facilitator,what do you mean oh part 4
Co-Facilitator,designing program in your team mate number guessing game take turns typing in the code save your work use the code in cell 23 to start your game then ask someone from another team to play your game so oh like this one
Co-Facilitator,yeah so this is the game right so we are just creating it so what is your name do you guys wanna change it to something else
Co-Facilitator,but like both of you think of something together like what do you guys wanted to be like what is your favorite color your favorite animal your favorite food
Co-Facilitator,just like type something
Co-Facilitator,like what is your favorite food then
Co-Facilitator,so like no im asking you guys to type what is your favorite food do you guys get it
Co-Facilitator,another question
Co-Facilitator,so just type
Co-Facilitator,okay
Co-Facilitator,just type
Co-Facilitator,i think we should change i dont want it to be that hard but yeah think about it so now is doing the same thing as it did last time so now we could change it we could put
Co-Facilitator,the number is to onion press pizza
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,high
Co-Facilitator,hello and then change the name for like that is a cool animal or something just make something up
Co-Facilitator,so just run it or are we still making something up
Co-Facilitator,just run it
Co-Facilitator,go
Co-Facilitator,oh you put animals
Co-Facilitator,so over here put cool animal and then 
Co-Facilitator,i laugh because of what i said
Co-Facilitator,present
Co-Facilitator,skip to the next part
Co-Facilitator,unintelligible
Co-Facilitator,okay so go to terminal that thing
Co-Facilitator,so we are just gonna go to session three
Co-Facilitator,how do you go to session three i forgot
Co-Facilitator,which one is file
Co-Facilitator,session three
Co-Facilitator,okay so we open that right run it and analyze in cells aa b and c there is some phytons code pay attention to the code in the cell and run them what happens when you run each cell when you change some of the numbers in the code and run it what happens right here right
Co-Facilitator,okay so she runs it
Co-Facilitator,so what you guys think happen it just went four and then went one
Co-Facilitator,me neither
Co-Facilitator,which one these one
Co-Facilitator,oh okay so i equals 1
Co-Facilitator,parentisis right
Co-Facilitator,like what
Co-Facilitator,i
Co-Facilitator,to 1
Co-Facilitator,so that is like saying i equals 1 and 1 multiply is 2
Co-Facilitator,okay you understand right
Co-Facilitator,maya
Co-Facilitator,so the same thing happen right now we have like last time
Co-Facilitator,so it starts at i right
Co-Facilitator,and step is one so now all that here says is 1step i so why do you think guys that is
Co-Facilitator,so 11 cause that means 1 and the start is one so 11 pretty much cause that would mean that is 2 and the 1 is up here so that would mean that is this one
Co-Facilitator,i and i but how did it get through
Co-Facilitator,all these
Co-Facilitator,so what happen
Co-Facilitator,define the value to count by or and up to the intentional value
Co-Facilitator,one
Co-Facilitator,one
Co-Facilitator,because it always stops one number before four
Co-Facilitator,can you like explain it
Co-Facilitator,explain it
Co-Facilitator,so it says give me a start number
Co-Facilitator,so give me a start number
Co-Facilitator,and a stop number
Co-Facilitator,give me a big one sorry
Co-Facilitator,so you are telling it to start at 2 right and you are telling it to start at 4 so 23 so it would be 5 right
Facilitator,hello
Facilitator,doing okay
Facilitator,got everything you need
Facilitator,you have a little marker here you know that
Facilitator,okay
Facilitator,you guys have the numbers from zero to fifteen right
Facilitator,do you have the manipulatives
Facilitator,do you need the  or you already did it
Facilitator,you already did it everybody understands
Facilitator,okay
Facilitator,hello suzette what are they putting you to do today benny also congratulations what were you yesterday goalkeeper
Facilitator,no what did you play

Facilitator,okay and what type of pone do you have
Facilitator,oh okay no juegas clash of clans no you dont play clash of clans no
Facilitator,i like it cause its easy its really easy actually all i have to do is post something to build and then forget about it and then you come back and thats it and then when you need money you just kill someone you attack someone
Facilitator,and then you get a bunch of rupees
Facilitator,they are called town holds but yeah
Facilitator,they are like castles so the bigger the level in the castle the uh the more things eh the more like you can upgrade
Facilitator,yeah
Facilitator,i know i mean i saw a lot of people i saw a really funny video online that like this guy is all killing everybody and then he is like building stuff around him to protect himself at the end and then he builds himself on a bush and then like he steps onto the bush and then it happened to be someone and he killed him and he lost and he was like being really good and because of someone because he built a house inside this bush he lost because of that
Facilitator,oh really so you can shoot the bushes so you can discover people i guess
Facilitator,when you shoot does does it show your location or what
Facilitator,no no no if you are around like walking around and you happen to shoot will it will it show to the people that are around or what
Facilitator,yeah give me a second i have to use uh 
Facilitator,matias you have to be more interested on the topic you are falling asleep and thinking of other things and you wake up when you see that
Facilitator,mhm
Facilitator,yes it says it itself
Facilitator,make things easy
Facilitator,okay lets see lets do three point three because it goes before like the spice and all that lets see where you say
Facilitator,i like the hree point two
Facilitator,yes lets see what it says there
Facilitator,we did this one already
Facilitator,three point three lets start with that one
Facilitator,lets see it says that moving the aolme spray with idol okay so tris one this program is the one that we will use first this mainly for to make the video that we will do programming it so we will get used to this lets see lets see
Facilitator,book two python idol to open python to open idol click ion python idol okay its a program i dont see it though
Facilitator,where is it
Facilitator,okay so its on the last page of open idol
Facilitator,yeah but are we using
Facilitator,yeah so if you are on open three three open idol
Facilitator,okay a ver matias abre abre el python open python python tres idol okay lets see matias open open python open python python three idol
Facilitator,okay
Facilitator,lets see let me borrow it
Facilitator,open open uh idol 
Facilitator,threre it is
Facilitator,that one doble click quick there it is does this one work yes now
Facilitator,file open
Facilitator,where it says file open file
Facilitator,go to file then
Facilitator,session three
Facilitator,session three then click where it says directory there where it says directory there where it says directory up where it says homepy click there lets see click home no it has to be there right lets see click there click on the other side where it says where it says open there on the top
Facilitator,lets see look for it there clock on the right on the bar there click keep clicking to find it it says that you have to finf a folder called session three keep clicking i think it will be in aolme doble click on aolme you see it now on top of desktop there it is now session three
Facilitator,and then mhm and then it says game game py click open
Facilitator,and then open like that too okay look thats the code okay we use lets see what does the first line mean do you remember what does the first line mean the first line always when you have when you have that hashtag
Facilitator,they are comments they dont mean anything to the program okay
Facilitator,the what does the fourth line mean tell me what does it say lets see read it in english line number four the line number four
Facilitator,what does it say what does it say
Facilitator,they are just comments those dont they dont influence the program also the
Facilitator,to the code it doesnt influence at all they are just note so that you remember what they do so look what do you think the line two does or what does it mean
Facilitator,are we missing somebody from the group
Facilitator,two people why miguel i think he comes from the elementary school so usually he comes here late i dont know if it i because
Facilitator,no hes not
Facilitator,i dont know but last time miguel came but he came late
Facilitator,thats okay
Facilitator,move sprite right
Facilitator,yes so do you know what does up down left and right mean in english
Facilitator,down means down the right up and left
Facilitator,so we are going to learn what they are in english but well they are very used in in in in programming so specially what we are going to do so remember more or less what down right up and left are its
Facilitator,down right up and left
Facilitator,okay entonces lo unico que va a ser mira  okay so the only thing we will do look
Facilitator,do you think that
Facilitator,do you know what scene means
Facilitator,so what do you think that that this command means it says scene in spanish it would translate to scene
Facilitator,this block
Facilitator,what do you think that means what do you think that one will do
Facilitator,so what its doing here is setting this variable show then scene play game then look
Facilitator,grab the mouse and click in run and tell it run module lets see what happens
Facilitator,what is it doing
Facilitator,what is it what is it doing
Facilitator,so what we have to do here is modify this scene do do that so the only thing you have to do is do you see that its working what you can do is modify this click run and see what happens so try to modify it however you want
Facilitator,how would you modify it to
Facilitator,go twice down then to the right again to the right and then like twice again up so modify the code to do that
Facilitator,yes so you can only do copy and
Facilitator,one so we have these functions and what you have to do is add more functions so change your code to add those functions that you need
Facilitator,so what do we have to do you can modify the code as you want thats it they are just functions the first one tells you to go down the second one to go right
Facilitator,the third one up so if you wanted it to go down twice what would you have to type
Facilitator,so you have to put this one twice thats it
Facilitator,select a line any okay
Facilitator,its okay okay so that line is the code that tells you that the little monkey will go down so what we have to do is copy that so you do control c to copy
Facilitator,or you can do right click control its this one so press that one leave it pressed and press now with the with c another another way of you just copied it another way of copying it would be  doing right click and then
Facilitator,copu okay now in the next line make a new line do you know how to make a new line
Facilitator,where does the line go to the end
Facilitator,mhm
Facilitator,hit hit enter to make another line now do right click
Facilitator,control v
Facilitator,now we are going to we are going to run it click in run to see what did it do
Facilitator,si
Facilitator,it is asking if you want to save your code say yes so what we will do is it will run again and it will read that code and make the scene okay do you see what it did
Facilitator,yes so just how you just did it do it now with the with the code that we have so go back to the code i think its there just click so modify the code that you have there any way you want so there isnt there isnt a good or bad answer
Facilitator,its to the right so click copy do you remember how to copy
Facilitator,first you have to copy because you copied a diff the previous one now you have to copy that one
Facilitator,okay now its copied now you have to
Facilitator,you have to deselect so click in the other side its already selected and now well you can make a new line
Facilitator,and now paste
Facilitator,okay and then f you want to run it or you know how it will go
Facilitator,click look now what
Facilitator,okay then do it
Facilitator,yes you only have to go up once more right
Facilitator,do what you do start here
Facilitator,it goes down one time twice three four then up and then up again
Facilitator,i think you are need it twice right dont you think so because its already you are here and then it goes up
Facilitator,and then it comes back what we want it to do is to come back so copy that one
Facilitator,okay and then add it
Facilitator,mhm
Facilitator,do you want do you want the monkey to go left or not the monkey the only thing we have to do is that make the monkey to get here
Facilitator,so there are two ways of removing that from the code what do you think its the first one
Facilitator,the first one is way too easy how do you remove that
Facilitator,whats the second way that you could remove it one the second way that the moves remove things
Facilitator,they add them they add them as a comment because the comments are not read right so the only thing you have to add is the hashtag but i dont know how to do hashtag so we are just going to erase it or we could copy it that one if you add that one it turns red and the program is showing you that that line wont be read or you could delete it whatever you want
Facilitator,lets see how how it shows
Facilitator,its like thats how games are coded more or less but sometimes you just have to
Facilitator,so whe when it finishes technically its here but it does it so fast that you dont get to see it so what we have to do is like yes because it starts here but but when it finishes here it it repeats right but actually it is here just that it went that fast that we didnt get to see it okay
Facilitator,sorry there it is lets see what other thing we are going to do
Facilitator, okay looks like you guys got it no
Facilitator,alright see hes done lets do four four four four is there 
Facilitator,eh before we move on i need you to to write in your book in your notebook
Facilitator,then theyre behind they just gotta catch up somehow this is just to get them started you know its gonna get pretty repetitive after a while and its gonna be whatever we wanna make so
Facilitator,in a way its like you fall behind but you can still catch up
Facilitator,what you whatever you learned you can also read this here it explains more or less what we tried explaining
Facilitator,who no its okay he is learning more
Facilitator,who 
Facilitator,like you mean like a facilitator
Facilitator,student
Facilitator,oh maybe or maybe theyre just lazy they didnt wanna come today
Facilitator,i dont know to be honest there are times that you like to well they prefer going to that thing you know i dont know
Facilitator,hey and they have things to do or something we dont know
Facilitator, whats that
Facilitator, i think so i dont see why not
Facilitator,maybe sometimes it is sometimes you gotta talk to people and talk to marios and silvia and find out but most of the time i dont think its a  
Facilitator,look we are going to learn something interesting again
Facilitator,no we are going to learn about how the human beings invented the colors in computers how do you think that human beings invented the colors in computers its so easy but it is not easy
Facilitator,they are two just two things
Facilitator,they are two numbers they are just two numbers two numbers with two numbers you can make colors
Facilitator,even if he tells you just tell me how many num no in our normal system of the human beings how many numbers do we have
Facilitator,it is not true yes it is infinite but we combine them how many whats the total of numbers that we have to to know because if you think about it if we put two numbers together  well it is a different number but actually how many numbers do we have you have them in your palm in your hands
Facilitator,we only have ten numbers right what is the representation of numbers
Facilitator,the zero the zero one two three four all the way up to nine right and when you make the ten you combine one and zero when its eleven its one and one etc in binary numbers there are just two numbers zero and one right and you combine them
Facilitator,to keep counting even if it has zero and one we can keep counting we have zero one and how would you make two you can put zero one or one zero its actually one zero wait ill write it down
Facilitator,i think so i think they are on the box maybe  but we are just gonna get started like simple
Facilitator,yeah well we have one two three well this means
Facilitator,zero one two three etc when we have zero and one we have the zero and the one this one could be the zero and this one would be the one and to make the two we could do it this way it is somehow confusing right but but it is how you can make two to do three we can do it this way
Facilitator,so to do three how do you think that we would do four
Facilitator,well not that one yet ahm it is a combination of that right
